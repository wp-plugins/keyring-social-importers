Requires at least: 3.3
Tested up to: 4.0
Stable Tag: 1.4

Take back control of the content you are creating on other social websites.

== Description ==

**Please [read about each importer](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/keyring-social-importers/other_notes/) before running this plugin**

**NOTE: This is "pre-release" software! It's likely to miss importing some content, import it in a format you don't like, or something else. You should run it on a test WordPress install to see how it works before running it anywhere near a live site!**

This package of social importers provide you with the ability to pull in your content that gets created on other sites, and re-publish it on your own WordPress site. Rather than leaving others in control of everything you've put time and effort into, why not host it yourself on your one true, home-on-the-web, WordPress?

After an initial import, all of these importers will also optionally check each hour and automatically download new content as well, keeping things in sync over time. They all currently import as Posts, with specific [Post Formats](http://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Formats).

Importers included currently:

* [Delicious](http://delicious.com/)
* [Flickr](http://flickr.com/)
* [Foursquare](http://foursquare.com/)
* [Instagram](http://instagram.com/)
* [Instapaper](http://instapaper.com/)
* [TripIt](http://tripit.com/)
* [Twitter](http://twitter.com/)

You can potentially write your own importers as well, using the base class included.

== Installation ==

0. Install and activate the [Keyring plugin](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/keyring/), which is required for authentication.
1. Install Keyring Social Importers either via the WordPress.org plugin directory, or by uploading the files to your server
2. Activate Keyring in Plugins > Installed Plugins

= Common Features =
* If you select to 'auto-import new content', all importers will check once per hour for new content
* A custom field called 'keyring_service' will be stored against each imported item, containing the name of the service used to import the content (e.g. 'twitter', 'instagram')

* For every photo, a Post is created and published, containing that one image (and it is attached within WordPress)
* Posts are marked with the 'image' Post Format
* Posts are created with the publish date matching the 'Taken' date of the photo. The modified date (of the Post) is set to the 'Upload' date from Flickr

* Posts are marked with the 'image' Post Format

= TripIt =

* Posts are marked with the 'aside' Post Format

== Changelog ==
= 1.4 =
* BREAKING: Change from using a value in post meta (keyring_service) to using a custom taxonomy ('keyring_services') to reference the service a post was imported from. Entries are automatically created for all importers.
* There is a script called 'migrate-keyring-postmeta-to-taxonomy.php' included in the plugin. Put it in the root of your WP install and run it (as many times as necessary, even if it crashes/runs out of memory) until it produces no output. That will convert all existing posts and remove their keyring_service postmeta.
* Fix deprecated notice and use esc_sql()
* Fix a string that didn't havea a textdomain
* Tweak Instapaper importer to use last progress date to get links published closer to when you read them

= 1.3 =
* Update Twitter API URLs to use new 1.1 API
* Foursquare check-ins that contain photos now download and attach the photo to your local post, props Chris Finke
* Added an action which is fired after *each post* is created/imported: do_action( 'keyring_post_imported', $post_id, $service_name, $post );
* Add import_start/end actions which are called in core importers (for consistency)

= 1.2 =

* NEW: Instapaper importer
* NEW: TripIt importer
* Only send the "must install Keyring" message once per page
